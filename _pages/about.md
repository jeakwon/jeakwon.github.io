I am very interested in finding the link between the human mind and artificial intelligence. Uncovering the secrets of the human mind or developing artificial intelligence inspired by the human mind is all that excites me. During my PhD, my main research expertise was electrophysiology and analysis of animal behavior. At the time, I wondered how the chaotic, asynchronous electrical signals generated by the brain's numerous neurons could shape higher-order "intelligence" and create non-random patterns of behavior. Now, to answer that question, I am interested in creating artificial intelligence that utilizes many interesting clues that exist in the brain. Even if the model I create may be far from the actual working principle of the brain, and there may be no improvement in performance, one thing is clear, the process is very enjoyable. I wouldn't hesitate to talk to you if you share the same thoughts with me. I believe any crazy idea is worth a try if it can excite people.
