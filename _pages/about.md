I am a physicist passionate about AI and did my PhD in physics at KAIST, Korea. Under professor [Hawoong Jeong](https://stat.kaist.ac.kr/~hjeong/)'s supervision, I worked on applications of ML in complex systems and statistical physics. My current research focus is understanding highly complex nonequilibrium systems, such as biological systems, active matter, and others in nature, through stochastic thermodynamics with ML-based approaches.
