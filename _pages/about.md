I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)](https://www.mpi-sp.org/) in Bochum, Germany. My research focuses on brain-inspired machine intelligence, exploring how principles from neuroscience can inform the design of more capable and aligned AI systems.

I received my Ph.D. in Brain and Cognitive Engineering from Korea University, where I developed deep learning approaches for animal behavior analysis. Previously, I worked at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST).

My current research interests span three themes: **machine memory** (memory-driven learning), **machine behavior** (human-like decision-making and AI alignment), and **machine emotion** (empathetic machines). I develop computational tools bridging neuroscience and AI, including [SUBTLE](https://github.com/jeakwon/subtle) for unsupervised behavior mapping and [Lp-Convolution](https://github.com/jeakwon/lpconv) for brain-inspired visual processing.
